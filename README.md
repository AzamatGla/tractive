## This is a web application that includes a grid with Create Read Update and Delete functionality.
### You can create your own grid or import a json file.

in front of each row we have two buttons, one of them is "delete" button and another is "update/submit" button.
If we press "submit", the row cannot be updated.
If we press "add new row", new empty row appears and it is updateble, the previous rows becomes non-updateble unless you press "update"

For testing you can import file called data.json from this repository
